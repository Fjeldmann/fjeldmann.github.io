            <h2>Why Fjeldmann Was Created</h2>
            <p>Fjeldmann was born when Oliver and I met during parental leave. Countless conversations during strolls with our children revealed a shared passion and a common dream.</p>
            
            <p>We believe that in complex situations, what you need most are simple solutions. We believe that the greatest impact, often comes from small, focused products. We believe that in an era where every company is striving to be AI-first, what we truly need is a people-first company.</p>
            
            <p>Fjeldmann exists to put people at the center of everything we do.</p>
            
            <h2>Why Choose Us</h2>
